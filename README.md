## Vector DB Todo List

I thought it would be fun to see if I can make a password protected todo list app by using a vector database as my only storage solution. 

To be clear, I don't think this is a good idea and it's definitely not the purpose of vector databases. Nevertheless, it was fun!

## Tech 
- Vector DB: [Upstash Vector](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/) with the [TS SDK](https://github.com/upstash/vector-js)
- Embedding model: [OpenAI text-embedding-3-small](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates)
- Next.js 14
